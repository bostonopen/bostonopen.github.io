These meetups are extremely casual. Often [we](https://bostonopen.github.io/people) are around 7-10 people. We eat. We chat. We talk about open source. We talk about all kinds of things. Whether you're an experienced open source developer or user, or you're just curious about open source, you're welcome to join!

You can just show up, but since we are always asked how large of a table we need, we appreciate you letting us know if you're coming. You can post on [Zulip][], <a rel="me" href="https://floss.social/@bostonopen">Mastodon</a>, or [GitHub Discussions][]. Or you can email <philipdurbin@gmail.com>.
