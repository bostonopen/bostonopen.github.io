These meetups are extremely casual. Often [we](https://bostonopen.github.io/people) are around 7-10 people. We eat. We chat. We talk about open source. We talk about all kinds of things.

You can just show up, but since we are always asked how large of a table we need, we appreciate you letting us know if you're coming. You can email <philipdurbin@gmail.com> or post on the [Zulip topic][].
